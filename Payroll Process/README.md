# Add New Staff
## contract_information
The purpose of this script is to utilize Selenium to extract employee contract information from T-hub, a platform that charges for each API request. By using this script, you can avoid incurring additional charges and instead directly obtain the necessary employee contract data from T-hub. The collected data can then be conveniently integrated into your payroll system using EXO.py.

## EXO.py
This script is intended to utilize the PyAutoGUI library and guide the user in entering employee information into a payroll system, as there is no import option available.

# Automate Public Holiday pay calculation
## Regular_hours_Weighted.py
The purpose of this script is to accurately calculate the weekly normal work hours of employees in the retail industry, which can be subject to flexibility. 
In addition, the script compares these work hours to the agreed-upon employee hours to determine whether the agreement is still current. The output of this calculation is then utilized to calculate both public holiday non-work hours pay and public holiday penalty time of in lieu pay. 

## Template_AddHours1.1.py
The purpose of this script is to accurately calculate both public holiday non-work hours pay and public holiday penalty time of in lieu pay. These calculations are based on the current payrun timesheet, as well as individual employee regular hours that are generated using the Regular_Hours_Weighted.py script.
