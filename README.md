# Lewis Projects
The Purpose of this repository is to demostrate the work project as well as my personal project I developed. 

## Weekly Deposit
I developed an Excel VBA user interface for our weekly cash deposit process, which generates a report for store managers to monitor cash transactions. This system has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of our cash management process, providing a streamlined solution for our weekly cash deposits. By implementing this tool, we can now easily track cash flow on a weekly basis, allowing our management team to stay informed of our financial status. 

## Deputy API
I have created a script that retrieves data from Deputy API
The script is designed to request  
- Employee information
- timesheet
- modifited timesheet after timesheet approval cutoff time.

## MYOB Esential API
I have created a script that retrieves data from MYOB Essentials API
The script is designed to request  
- the monthly balance and profit and loss report.

### Payroll Process
I have created a series of customized scripts for payroll processing, which have been tailored to best suit the specific needs and requirements of the company.
