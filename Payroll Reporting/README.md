# Description of File

### Overtime.py
The purpose of the script is to create an Excel report that highlights employees who have worked more than 76 hours in a fortnight, along with their timesheets. This report will help store managers optimize productivity and reduce costs by avoiding overtime payments. It provides valuable insights into employee performance and helps managers make data-driven decisions.

### ALandTOIL.py
This script is designed to produce a comprehensive report of each employee's remaining leave balance, including their annual leave, sick leave, and the time in lieu. The ultimate goal is to assist managers in guiding their employees to take time off at the earliest opportunity and prevent any unnecessary overtime payments.

### Head_Count2.0.py
This script retrieves data from a payroll database and serves as the data source for generating a headcount report for both the HR and Sales departments. 
The report includes information on the number of active employees in various categories, such as full-time, part-time, and casual, as well as the number of employees who have joined or left. 
The report also provides data on full-time equivalents, revenue and gross profit per full-time equivalent, and the attrition rate at both the department and store levels. 
Additionally, the report identifies any ghost accounts that may be active but do not have a roster for the month. This information helps ensure that these accounts are made inactive, which helps avoid any unnecessary costs.
