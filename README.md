The Purpose of this repository is to demostrate the work project I developed for resume. 

# Weekly Deposit
I developed an Excel VBA user interface for our weekly cash deposit process, which generates a report for store managers to monitor cash transactions. This system has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of our cash management process, providing a streamlined solution for our weekly cash deposits. By implementing this tool, we can now easily track cash flow on a weekly basis, allowing our management team to stay informed of our financial status.
